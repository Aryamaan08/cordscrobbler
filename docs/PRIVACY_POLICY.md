This privacy policy informs you what data this service collects and how it is collected and used by this service, and is effective as of **August 14, 2020**.

# What information does this service collect and for what purposes?

To provide the scrobbling service, when you register (connect your Last.fm account with the bot), the date and time of your registration, your Discord account ID, your Last.fm username, your preferences, and a Last.fm session key, used to perform actions on your behalf on your Last.fm account, are stored in a database. This data travels encrypted between Discord's network and Firebase from Google and is stored encrypted at rest on Google Firebase Firestore servers.

Additionally, when you add the bot to a Discord server, it analyzes messages to collect music playback data from other bots. Such data is used to obtain additional information about the music and perform scrobbling on the Last.fm account; it can be stored in the database to compose a history of listened songs and perform additional scrobble attempts in case of failure. This service collects other data from Discord's servers where the bot is added, such as the identification of users connected on voice channels, to determine whether a registered user has listened to a particular track. Data related to unregistered users on this service is discarded. This service does not perform voice recordings of users.

Additional data on users' use of this bot can be collected for maintenance and improvement purposes of this service.

At any time, you can undo your registration. In this case, the data stored about you, including your session key, is deleted from the database. As more people may be listening together with you on the same channel, music playback data can be maintained to provide the service to other users. In the case of suspected misuse (such as mass message triggering), the access to this service can be suspended for you. In this case, your Discord user ID will be stored in our database to identify you and block your access.

The data that this service collects is not sold to third parties.

This service is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.
